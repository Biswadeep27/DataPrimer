Apache Arrow is One of such libraries in the data processing and data science space, A critical component of Apache Arrow is its 
in-memory columnar format, a standardized, language-agnostic specification for representing structured, table-like datasets in-memory. 
This data format has a rich data type system (included nested and user-defined data types) designed to support the needs of analytic database systems, 
data frame libraries, and more,

Arrow is used by open-source projects like Apache Parquet, Apache Spark, pandas, and many other big data tools.

It provides the following functionality:
=========================================
1. In-memory computing.
2. A standardized columnar storage format (Majorly Parquet).
3. An IPC and RPC framework for data exchange between processes and nodes respectively.
4. Cross-language interoperability.
5. Apache Arrow enables to transfer of data precisely between Java Virtual Machine and executors of Python with zero serialization cost by 
leveraging the Arrow columnar memory layout to fasten up the processing of string data.

Arrow’s in-memory columnar data format is an out-of-the-box solution to these problems. 
Systems that use or support Arrow can transfer data between them at little-to-no cost. 
Moreover, they don’t need to implement custom connectors for every other system.

Arrow uses memory-mapping of its files to load only as much data into memory as necessary and possible.

PySpark with PyArrow:
=====================
1. The Arrow Python bindings PyArrow” have first-class integration with NumPy, pandas, and built-in Python objects. 
They are based on the C++ implementation of Arrow since version 2.3.
